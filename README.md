Kykinite
---
Kykinite is a mod about augmenting armor through vanilla materials and the alike.

- It features a new ore found exclusively in the End, called Kykinite.
Kykinite, in its base form, can be used to make Kykinite armor and Refined Kykinite
- Refined Kykinite can be combined with Vanilla Materials to create "Ascension Kykinite" of that material's type.
- The Ascension Kykinite is then combined with the Kykinite armor to boost the Kykinite Armor's power.
- Currently, Iron, Diamond, Netherite, Gold, Quartz, and "Powered Quartz" are supported

The mod is Fabric Exclusive, as you are looking at the github, Im assuming you are aware of this. If you wish, you are free to port to Forge if you are capable of coding and love the mod.

Feel free to put this in a modpack, credit is preferred but not required.

If you have any suggestions or bugs, refer to the issue tracker.

If you are wondering about if you can use part of the code for your own project, feel free! I dont think my code is of high quality but if your wondering "How do I do this?" you may reference my code. (Hopefully MIT License allows that.)
